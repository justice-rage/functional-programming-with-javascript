# Functional Programming with JavaScript
## _whiteboarding Independent Project_

During the Epicodus React section instead of creating React based projects for our independent projects bootcamp students are instead being given five whiteboarding questions to study for a whiteboarding exams that occur every two weeks. Questions are expected to be solved utilizing functional programming concepts, and many require recursive solutions.

that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

### Question 1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

### Question 2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

### Question 3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"

### Question 4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

Example
Input: "hello"

Output: false

Input: "copyright"

Output: true

### Question 5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]
